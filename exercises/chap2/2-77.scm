;;;; Exercise 2.77

;;; Figure 2.24
;;; complex tag -> rectanglular tag -> (3, 4)

;;; Louis Reasoner tries to evaluate the expression (magnitude z) where z
;;; is the object shown in figure 2.24. To his surprise, instead of the
;;; answer 5 he gets an error message from apply-generic, saying there is
;;; no method for the operation magnitude on the types (complex). He shows
;;; this interaction to Alyssa P. Hacker, who says ``The problem is that
;;; the complex-number selectors were never defined for complex numbers,
;;; just for polar and rectangular numbers. All you have to do to make
;;; this work is add the following to the complex package:''

(put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(complex) angle)

;;; Describe in detail why this works. As an example, trace through all
;;; the procedures called in evaluating the expression (magnitude z)
;;; where z is the object shown in figure 2.24. In particular, how many
;;; times is apply-generic invoked? What procedure is dispatched to
;;; in each case?

;;; Answer:
;;; Apply-generic is invoked twice.
;;; 
;;; (magnitude z)
;;; (apply-generic 'magnitude z)    ; outerest tag is complex
;;; (apply-generic 'magnitude z)    ; outerest tag is retangular
;;; (magnitude z)
